A set of LUA primitives.

## Contribution Guide

Contributions can be made with a github pull request but features and/or
changes need to be discussed first. Code is licensed under LGPLv3 and
contributions must be licensed under the same. For any issues or feature
requests please use the issue tracker and file a new issue. Make sure to
provide as much detail about the problem or feature as possible. New
development is done in feature branches which are eventually merged into
`master`, base your features and fixes off `master`.

### Development Environment Setup

All development is done on [Debian Stable](https://www.debian.org/).
You can setup your own development environment by running the setup script.

Run the following on your system:
```
git clone https://github.com/jtoppins/lua-libs.git
cd lua-libs
sudo ./scripts/devel-setup
```
